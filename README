ASSIGNMENT: Matrix Completion

We're given a dataset in mat_comp (or mat_comp_small) of pairs of users, movies and ratings from .5 to 5 (jumping by .5). 
We want to be able to predict what a user will rate a given movie on an example we haven't seen. 

Essentially, we wish to find an nxm matrix M, where n is the number of users and m is the number of movies. We currently have
a series of entries Mij of the matrix,specifically k entries. We wish to use those entries to predict the rest. 

To do this, we assume that M = X@Y^T for some X size nxr, Y size mxr, where r is the rank of the matrix M(unknown). 
We want to minimize the loss function 
f(X,Y) = sum_{i,j in omega}(Mij - XY^Tij)^2.
